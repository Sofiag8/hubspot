# Workflow Custom Code [Contact/Account] Pass the Activities from Contact Records to associated Accounts and associated Household

The activity starts on the contact record. If an custom1 record is associated to the contact then the activity needs to be passed (or associated) to the custom1 record. Same thing will happen with the custom2 object. If there is an associated custom2 to the custom1, pass that activity to the custom2 record associated.

## Activities
